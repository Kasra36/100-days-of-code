# 💯 100 Days of Code – Python Projects

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfCode** journey!  
This repository isn’t just a log — it’s a portfolio in motion. It captures my progress through Python development challenges, automation tasks, web scraping, GUI apps, API integrations, and more.

## 🚀 About the Challenge

The **#100DaysOfCode** challenge is a daily commitment to code consistently for 100 days.  
Each day, I tackled a new concept or built something to deepen my understanding and stretch my skills.

This repo doesn’t log every single day — instead, it highlights the **most challenging and rewarding milestones**.

While following the structure of [Dr. Angela Yu’s Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), I went beyond the base material by adding custom features, doing extra research, and refining each project where possible.
